# Fix Mycouse Page - Implementation Plan

## Tasks to Complete:
- [ ] Convert single course view to course list view
- [ ] Replace hardcoded data with dynamic data from $courses
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Implement progress calculation for each course
- [ ] Fix sidebar navigation links
- [ ] Add proper pagination display
- [ ] Update breadcrumb to reflect list view

## Current Issues Identified:
1. Controller returns list of courses but view shows single course
2. All data is hardcoded (course title, image, instructor, curriculum)
3. Progress percentage is hardcoded (12%)
4. Navigation links are placeholder (#)
5. No search functionality visible

## Approach:
- Create a grid/list layout for multiple courses
- Loop through $courses to display each purchased course
- Calculate progress based on completed series
- Add search form at the top
- Update sidebar with proper route links
